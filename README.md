In this competition, I tried various albumentations, transformations and different ensembling techniques to boost my score.
The data was less so albumentations played a very crucial role. I tried ensembling different CNN models like resnet, densenet, googlenet and similar counterparts of these models which made up a total of 40 models. I also tried stacking which actually increased my score. Overall, I learned a lot from this competition.
